Project 1: Predicting a Passenger’s Survival Rate in the Titanic Disaster Using Gaussian-KNN Classifier, Project 2: Spam Prediction using Naive Bayes Classifier (IP WEEK 9 DATA SCIENCE CORE-Feb,2022),

Content Description
Project 1: Kaggle conducted a supervised learning challenge on predicting the Titanic Passenger Survival Rate. The data collected captured various variables that would help predict the survival rate of passengers.

Project 2: Data was collected and stored in the Machine Learning Repository after a series of approved field work. The data captured would help build predictive models on how email service providers can build predictive models differentiating between spam and harmful mail

The dataset link to dataset 1(Training dataset https://archive.org/download/train5_202002/train%20%285%29.csv) and link 2 to test dataset(https://archive.org/download/test1_202002/test%20%281%29.csv). 
The link to dataset two is(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase). 
My objective is to use my data science skills and predict the survival rate of the passengers in the ship and come up with a predictive model differentiating spam and harmful mail.
